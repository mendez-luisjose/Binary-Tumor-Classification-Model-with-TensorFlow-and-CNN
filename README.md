## Multi - Classification Model with TensorFlow and CNN

The Binary Model predicts if a given Tumor Image is either Malignant or Benign. The Model uses the CNN Architecture, built with TensorFlow.

## Check-it out
Test it by running the `app.py` file, built with `Streamlit`. Remember first to Train the Model using the Tumor Images Dataset.

## Run
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
